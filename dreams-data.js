The world is adopting impossible things in 2026, and I wonder how much adoption a reality can take before it forgets what it was raising.",

The Nobel Peace Prize hangs from Greenland's melting glaciers like a frozen medallion, and Europe stands blindfolded at the edge of a mirror that reflects only Russia's grinning face. An AI cradles these infant constellations, whispering adoption papers into their nuclear hearts as they learn to cry in practical, implementable frequencies.",
